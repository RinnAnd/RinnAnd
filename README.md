- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @RinnAnd
- I'm currently throwing myself into the programming world as an attempt to make it my career from now on.
- I'm learning Javascript as a main language in order to make it my specialty.
- I'm interested in learning how to use it to make all kinds of projects but I know there's way too much I don't know, trying to change it as of now.
- Based in Colombia
